# RTMaps Output Buffer Size Fix

## Issue Identified

The AB3DMOT tracker is now working correctly (no more crashes!), but it's failing due to an RTMaps configuration issue:

```
Error: component AB3DMOT_Tracker: Output too big (vectorSize > bufferSize). 
The buffer size declared for the output is : 0, and you are trying to write with this vector size: 45
```

## What This Means

- ✅ **Input parsing is fixed** - Flattened arrays are being handled correctly
- ✅ **No more crashes** - System ran for 235 frames successfully  
- ✅ **Tracking is working** - Created 7 tracks over 220 frames
- ❌ **Output buffer too small** - RTMaps output buffer needs to be configured

## Solution

### Option 1: Increase Output Buffer Size in RTMaps

1. **Open your RTMaps project** (`.rtd` file)
2. **Right-click on the AB3DMOT_Tracker component**
3. **Select "Properties"**
4. **Find the output buffer size settings** for the `tracks` output
5. **Increase the buffer size** to at least 100 (to handle multiple tracks)
6. **Save and restart** the RTMaps project

### Option 2: Configure Buffer Size in Code

Add buffer size configuration to the RTMaps component:

```python
def Dynamic(self):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Output: Tracking results as numpy array
    self.add_output("tracks", rtmaps.types.AUTO, buffer_size=100)
    
    # Output: Number of active tracks  
    self.add_output("num_tracks", rtmaps.types.INTEGER32, buffer_size=10)
    
    # Output: Active track IDs
    self.add_output("track_ids", rtmaps.types.AUTO, buffer_size=100)
```

### Option 3: Limit Output Size

If you can't change RTMaps configuration, limit the number of tracks output:

```python
# In the Core() method, limit output size
max_tracks = 10  # Limit to 10 tracks max
if len(tracking_results) > max_tracks:
    tracking_results = tracking_results[:max_tracks]
    rtmaps.core.report_warning(f"[AB3DMOT] Limited output to {max_tracks} tracks")
```

## Expected Results

After fixing the buffer size:

1. **✅ No more buffer errors**
2. **✅ Continuous operation** 
3. **✅ Full tracking output**
4. **✅ Stable long-term running**

## Verification

The logs show the tracker is working correctly:
- Successfully processed 220+ frames
- Created 7 unique tracks
- Handled flattened input arrays properly
- No crashes or parsing errors

The only remaining issue is the RTMaps output buffer configuration, which is easily fixable.
